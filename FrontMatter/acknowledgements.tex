\section*{\centering Acknowledgements}


I am grateful to my supervisor Dr. Richard Jensen for all his help and support throughout the project, sharing his wealth of knowledge about clustering and ACO and for proof reading the report. I am also grateful to Amanda Clare for her feedback on the mid-project demonstration. 

I'd also like to thank my brother Jake for proof reading the report.
