abstract = "In the 2-period Travelling Salesman Problem some nodes, called double nodes, are visited in both of two periods while the remaining ones, called single nodes, are visited in either one of the periods. In this paper we study the case in which a balance constraint is also introduced. We require that the difference between the number of visited nodes in the two periods must be below a fixed threshold. Moreover, we suppose that distances between nodes are Euclidean. The problem is NP-hard, and exact methods, now available, appear inadequate. Here, we propose three heuristics. Computational experiences and a comparison between the algorithms are also given.",

abstract="Data clustering is one of important research topics of data mining. In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm based on ant colony optimization, called Ant Colony Optimization for Clustering (ACOC). At the core of the algorithm we use both the accumulated pheromone and the heuristic information, the distances between data objects and cluster centers of ants, to guide artificial ants to group data objects into proper clusters. This allows the algorithm to perform the clustering process more effectively and efficiently. Due to the nature of stochastic and population-based search, the ACOC can overcome the drawbacks of traditional clustering methods that easily converge to local optima. Experimental results show that the ACOC can find relatively good solutions.",
